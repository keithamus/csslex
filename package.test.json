The change you've provided is a modification in a JSON file, specifically, the removal of the "license" field. This can be tested using a testing library like Jest in JavaScript. Here's a simple test that checks whether the "license" field is undefined in the JSON file:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

test('license field should be removed', () => {
  const packageJson = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(path.resolve(__dirname, 'package.json'), 'utf8'));
  expect(packageJson.license).toBeUndefined();
});
```

This test reads the `package.json` file, parses it into a JavaScript object, and then asserts that the "license" field is undefined. If the "license" field is present in the file, the test will fail.
